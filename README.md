# lockd - Manage your lock screen

**Note:** This program is not intended for the average user using a desktop environment like Plasma, GNOME or Unity. This is intended for users of standalone window managers like i3, xmonad or awesome.

**WIP:** Please note that currently the lock command is hardcoded to `i3lock -c 000000 --nofork`

## Features
* Automatically locks screen when system gets suspended
* Will prevent suspend before screen is locked
* Has option to disable automatic suspend on lid close (TBD)
